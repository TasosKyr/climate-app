          <p className="card-text">A letter to the editor is a simple and effective way to raise the important issue of climate change in your community. The editorial pages are among the most-read sections of a newspaper, so a published letter can really get people thinking and talking about climate change.

Research has shown that people’s opinions are more likely to be influenced by their peers and community members than by experts, so your letter can have a real impact.

Share your views and help us reach our goal of 100 published letters to the editor, with at least one from each province and territory. This service is hosted by David Suzuki Foundation and New/Mode Community Engagement.</p>
